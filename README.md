# SAS-chi-square-binning-and-variable-reduction
In logistic model building, it is wise to bin continuous variable first to stop over-fitting, this code does this.
Using SAS, this bins variables based on chi-square then conducts variablereduction to keep powerful variables
Code also does correltation variable reduction
